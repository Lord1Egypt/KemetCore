# WORKLOG — Append-Only Record of Every Step

**Rules:**
- Append a new entry after **every** step. Newest at the BOTTOM. Never rewrite or
  delete past entries — this is the audit trail Mohamed rates you against.
- If you are blocked, add an entry under a `### NEEDS-MOHAMED` heading describing
  the decision you need, then work on something unblocked.
- One entry = one verified step. No entry = the step didn't happen.

**Entry format (copy this):**

```
### <YYYY-MM-DD> — <branch> — <one-line what>
- **Did:** <what you built/changed, which files>
- **Verified:** <exact command> → <result, e.g. "cocotb PASS bit-exact / 0 latches / Status: PASSED">
- **Tracking:** <manifest checkpoint id added, or "no status change">
- **Commit:** <hash> · **PR:** #<N> (<CI state>)
- **Self-rating:** <what shipped · strongest evidence · weakest/least-certain part>
```

### 2026-07-15 — main — Agent instruction set handed off
- **Did:** Created the agent operating contract: `AGENTS.md` + `GEMINI.md` at repo
  root, and `docs/agent/` (PLAYBOOK, AVOID_LIST, TASK_MENU, REVIEW_CHECKLIST, this
  WORKLOG). No source/RTL changed.
- **Verified:** N/A (docs only). Repo state confirmed: `main` clean, no open PRs,
  `pytest projects/ -q` green at handoff.
- **Tracking:** no status change.
- **Commit:** (this handoff commit) · **PR:** docs handoff
- **Self-rating:** Onboarding docs for the Gemini/Antigravity agent to continue
  KemetCore. Strongest evidence: paths/commands verified against the live repo and
  toolchain this session. Weakest part: the exact Antigravity config-file auto-load
  name may vary by version — `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` cover the common cases; if
  Antigravity looks for a different filename, symlink or copy `AGENTS.md` to it.
